# Contributing

The main purpose of this repository is to share our method and allow others
to reproduce our results.
Since reproducibility is our main goal, we'd prefer to avoid unnecessary
changes to this codebase.

Please open an issue if you encounter a bug or would like to suggest improvements.

We ask that potential contributors discuss prospective changes with us before
sending a pull request.
